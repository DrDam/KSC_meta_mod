Note on all icons::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

All icons contained in the 'RDSimpleIcons' folder are automatically loaded into the game and available to be placed on any custom tech tree node. 

All icons are supposed to be 64x64 in png format. Icons will be named after the myIcon.png template. In this case the name of the icon would be 'myIcon' and can be loaded by script with 'RDController.Instance.GetIcon("myIcon");'

Make sure to not use the '_' char or any other 'weird' chars in your icon names.
