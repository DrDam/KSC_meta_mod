	description = #autoLOC_500221 //#autoLOC_500221 = The R8 Active Control Winglet series marked the debut of Kerlington Model Rockets in the Spacecraft engineering world. These winglets are equipped with movable pivots, which allow them to swivel and act as control surfaces. This feature was considered a huge advancement in control technology and most agree that it made Kerlington staff and R8 fans simply unbearable to be around.
