Note on all icons::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

All icons contained in the 'Icons' and 'SimpleIcons' folders are automatically loaded into the game and available to be placed on any custom partlist tab category or subcategory.

All icons are supposed to be 32x32 in png format. Icons in the 'Icons' and 'SimpleIcons' folder will be named after the myIcon.png template. In this case the name of the icon would be 'myIcon' and can be loaded by script with 'PartCategorizer.Instance.GetIcon("myIcon");' Note that PartCategorizer is only instantiated within the VAB/SPH.

Make sure to not use the '_' char or any other 'weird' chars in your icon names.
