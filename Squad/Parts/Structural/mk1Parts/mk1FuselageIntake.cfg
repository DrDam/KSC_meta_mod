	description = #autoLOC_500734 //#autoLOC_500734 = This version of the Mk1 Fuselage module carries only a bit of fuel, but is fitted with a streamlined air intake. It consists of a "bump" and a forward-swept inlet cowl. This eliminates the need for a Splitter plate, while compressing the air to slow it down from supersonic to subsonic speeds. DSIs can be used to replace the intake ramp and inlet cone, which are more complex, heavy and expensive.
