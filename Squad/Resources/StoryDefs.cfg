        Generic = #autoLOC_501716 //#autoLOC_501716 = We're not sure if there really is such a thing as too many struts, but we'd like to find out.
        Generic = #autoLOC_501717 //#autoLOC_501717 = We're trying to figure out if all matter in the universe is as dense as on Kerbin, but haven't come up with a conclusive test for it.
        Generic = #autoLOC_501718 //#autoLOC_501718 = We want to know what shades of green we'll see if we expose a Kerbal to high gee forces.

        Launch = #autoLOC_501727 //#autoLOC_501727 = Nobody has set any space records yet! It would probably be best to just start by getting something off the launchpad. Then we can start worrying about things like "survivability".
        Orbit = #autoLOC_501728 //#autoLOC_501728 = The problem is that we don't actually have any idea how difficult it is to get a Kerbal to orbit, and we need to find out quickly.

        PlantFlag = #autoLOC_501740 //#autoLOC_501740 = We think that the aesthetic of [Topic] would be greatly improved with just one more flag, but we're not able to get one there ourselves.
        RecoverAsset = #autoLOC_501741 //#autoLOC_501741 = Apparently, using crewed craft is not a good way to test theories on the dangers of space junk. If you could bring [Topic] back home, we promise not to leave anyone else up there.
        RecoverKerbal = #autoLOC_501742 //#autoLOC_501742 = We've lost a Kerbal! Could you find [Topic] for us? Their snack supplies may be starting to run a little low.
        RecoverKerbal = #autoLOC_501743 //#autoLOC_501743 = We've been performing a lot of experiments with leaving Kerbals in space for extended periods of time. Things were going great, until [Topic] woke up one morning and decided to walk out of their capsule.
        RecoverKerbal = #autoLOC_501744 //#autoLOC_501744 = So apparently, [Topic] is having a lot of trouble with their EVA jetpack. So much so that the rest of the crew may have forgotten to wait for them to get back to the capsule, resulting in them being left in orbit.
        RecoverPart = #autoLOC_501745 //#autoLOC_501745 = We've been experimenting with methods of calculating delta-v without a Kerbal on board (a "Mechanical Bill Kerman" of sorts) and have run into some trouble. The problem being that we can't seem to get [Topic] back to Kerbin.
        RecoverPart = #autoLOC_501746 //#autoLOC_501746 = We've been experimenting with methods of calculating orbital information without a Kerbal on board (a "Jebediah's Engineer" of sorts) and have run into some trouble. The problem being that we can't seem to get [Topic] back to Kerbin.
        Satellite = #autoLOC_501747 //#autoLOC_501747 = We've got a competition to see which agency can get the most satellites in particular orbits, and would like some assistance.

        Tourism = #autoLOC_501751 //#autoLOC_501751 = We want to know if there are Kerbals that will really pay for the extra seats that you surely already have on your craft.
        Orbit = #autoLOC_501752 //#autoLOC_501752 = To get to orbit, we think all we need is for a Kerbal with terrible aim to shoot for the ground and miss.
        Orbit = #autoLOC_501753 //#autoLOC_501753 = We want to know if it's as fun as it seems to be in zero-G.
        Kerbin = #autoLOC_501754 //#autoLOC_501754 = We aren't sure if a day on Kerbin is 6 or 24 hours long.
        Kerbin = #autoLOC_501755 //#autoLOC_501755 = We'd like to check if Kerbin is in fact perfectly round, and not an oblate spheroid as some lunatics suggest.

        Minmus = #autoLOC_501761 //#autoLOC_501761 = We need to know if Minmus Mint Chip ice cream would really sell.
        MinmusSrf = #autoLOC_501762 //#autoLOC_501762 = We believe that it would be a lot of fun to jump around on Minmus.
        MinmusSrf = #autoLOC_501763 //#autoLOC_501763 = If the surface of Minmus isn't edible, will Kerbals still try to eat it?

        Sun = #autoLOC_501765 //#autoLOC_501765 = We suspect that there's interesting places to see beyond Kerbin and all its moons, although we suspect there's a lot of empty space in between.
